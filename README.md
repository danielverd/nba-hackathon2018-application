# nba-hackathon2018-application

The code in this repository is a full solution to the application question for the 2018 NBA Hackathon. I learned about the event about 3 days before the application deadline, so the code was never submitted. However, I recently came back and debugged the script so that it creates an output with reasonable data values.

The question asked to parse play by play data for 50 NBA games and calculate the Plus-Minus for every player that played in the game. Additional data files included the starting lineups for each team and a key for event codes (1 = Made Basket, 4 = Rebound, etc.). The full prompt is in the included PDF file.

The final script is stored in plus_minus.py and the iPython notebook includes my scratch notes, a few tests, and a bunch of print statements I used for debugging. The final result is stored in Indiana PaVers.csv. Shoutout to the r/pavers community during the 2018 playoffs.
